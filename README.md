- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @patientbird
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in front-end web development with JavaScript.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics! with the help of The Odin Project.

Currently work in marketing and looking to apply what I've learded about user behavior from a marketing view to inform and create web pages with effective UI and UX.
